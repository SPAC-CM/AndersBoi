Add which folder the project should be run from
Add where GRI and Metadata file should be placed
Better null handling instead of warnings:
	ExcelManager: line 51 -> 
			if(worksheet is not null){
				return worksheet.Rows.Count();
			}
			else {
		   		return 0;
		   	}
			line 66 ->
				if(worksheet is not null){
			line 84 ->
				}
				else{
					return new List<string>();
				}
State where the files will be downloaded. It is good practice to not put them outside of the project dir, unless you manually input directory
Remove commented code, it just confuses more than it helps:
	HTTP_Manager.cs line 61->65
Add how to run the project
Stop using readkey unless specifically needing userinput
Use less hardcoded variables, and instead give them as a parameter. Examlple GetGRINumb... it would be nice if you could provide the excel file name. Also makes it easier to test
In excel manager function of line 62. Needs a comment to describe what it is doing, specially since it has a magick number of 38 and 39
ExcelManager could use some refactoring. Namely why does the ReadMultiple... not use ReadRowFromExcel
Better variable names for the cells. Most people have 0 clue as to what the cell A is in the excelsheet (def most creaters too), so call it by the header instead ie. GRNum
In program.cs line 56: Cheks seems unnecesary since ReadMulti.... already makes that check
